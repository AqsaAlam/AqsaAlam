- 👋 Hi, I’m @AqsaAlam! 
- 👀 I’m interested in bioinformatics, biophysics, and really anything to do with data analysis in biology and physics.
- 🌱 I’m currently in my masters of Cell and Systems Biology in the Moses Lab at the University of Toronto. 
      I'm working on learning the functions of non-coding DNA using evolution and machine learning.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any projects that require data analysis skills.
- 📫 You can reach me by email at aqs.alam@mail.utoronto.ca
