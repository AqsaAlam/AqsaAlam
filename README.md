- 👋 Hi, I’m @AqsaAlam! 
- 👀 I’m interested in bioinformatics, biophysics, and really anything to do with data analysis in biology and physics.
- 🌱 Currently, I work at the Ontario Institute of Cancer Research (OICR) in downtown Toronto as a bioinformatician.
      I graduated from my masters in Cell and Systems Biology in the Moses Lab at the University of Toronto. 
      In my masters, I developed functionally informative representations of non-coding DNA using the conservation of motifs.
      My undergraduate degree was a double major in Biology and Physics at the University of Toronto Mississauga.
- 💞️ I’m not currently looking for work.
- 📫 You can reach me by email at aqs.alam@mail.utoronto.ca
